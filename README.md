During Comp 1004 Module I gained knowledge of HTML and JavaScript hence I have implemented these programming languages along with CSS.  The Primary domain and markup language is HTML which is also used to format or structure the webpages. CSS is used to give the webpages a consistent design and finally JavaScript is the Programming Language alongside Json application. The project should follow SMART Requirements (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Testable) this ensures that a project has some objectives that they can follow.
The email, and password of the user are gathered by the form. The JavaScript code gathers the form data into a JSON object named "userData" and stops the form from submitting when it is submitted.
